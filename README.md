# AttaDAC
A simple 8-channel DAC for use with microcontroller boards (e.g. Arduino)

Inspired by the OctoDAC project, the aim of this PCB is to deliver analog-out with higher precision than is included on MCUs - when they have any real analog output at all. 
Having specifically a (biological) research setting in mind, this should help replace more sophisticated devices in applications requiring less precision. 
For instance, certain effectors such mass flow controllers have an intrinsic inertia, so we can get away with some fluctutation.
Measurements of this board's performance are still pending.
